# Group Project Standards
As part of a wider group, it is important that an agreement is made among individual contributors to build synergy and uniformity in work submitted to the final product. <br/>

## Guidelines
To aid in the consistency and organization of the work we will produce, we need to have an agreed set of standards for 

### Individual Contributions
We will use GitHub to organize code into a development branches for individual work,  connected to a master repository. 

 - Check out work
 - perform coding work
 - check in work with a message (i.e. -m flag followed by a description )

### Coding Convention

- We need to have one person in charge of checking in branches into the master repository. This will add another layer of source control
- Use a consistent naming convention agreed among team (i.e. using underscores like: northern_hemisphere_temperature  or camel case like: nothernHemisphereTemperature)
- Use comments to describe what each step is doing. This will help teammates to understand the thought process and roadmap, which will help with debugging when things do go wrong


### Operating Standards
To ensure that each team is on the same page, we need to have  periodic checkpoint meetings. Beside completing the exercise, one of the main objectives is to get an assimulation of a real world working environment where we collaborate with other team members. The more tightly integrated we are as a team, the more efficiently we will work as a team and the more effective our work product will be.
